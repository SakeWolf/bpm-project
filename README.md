The BPM Project is an open-source web application intended for use as a basic metronome or rhythm keeper in musical applications. It will evetually feature an adjustable BPM, presets for common tempos, and customizable audio and visual cues per beat.

As a static web page, the application can be run simply by opening index.html in your browser of choice. The BPM Project currently uses HTML, CSS and Javascript/JQuery to run.

### Planned Features
- A visual indicator for the beat, likely a set of four indicators to match with each quarter beat.
- Presets for common tempos such as adagio, allegro and so on.
- Support for different time signatures.
- The ability for the user to upload their own tick sounds.
